Why Typscript with react?

=>  With static type checking, we get to learn about potential
    bugs as we are typing the code, than heading to the browser and
    figurng out at runtime.

=>  Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better
    documentation and autocomplete.

=>  Makes maintenence and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

But we have to warite a lot more code than we normally do and the compiler
keeps complaining. I simply don't know what to do about those errors.
It doesn't seem to be productive for us?
Ans. Practice more..

Type inference
Typescript will automatically try to assign the type and 
we only have to intervene when typescript needs a little bit of help.

Types vs Interfaces
use Types when building application and Interfaces when building libraries.
